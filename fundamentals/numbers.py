number1 = 1
number2 = 2
number3 = 10
number4 = 16

## Real basic operators
print(number1 + number2) # <- Addition
print(number3 - number2) # <- Subtraction
print(number2 * number3) # <- Multiplication
print(number4 / number3) # <- Division
print((number4 + number2) * number3) # A bit of BODMAS

## Powers
print(number3 ** number4) # <- Raise number3 to the power of number4 (so 10^16)
print(31.4159265359 * (10 ** -1)) # <- Raise original number to the power of 10^-1 (or divide by 10)

## Division
print(9 // 2) # Divide 9 by 2 (4.5) and round down (so answer is 4)
print(9%2) # Divide 9 by 2 and display the number(s) after the decimal place
